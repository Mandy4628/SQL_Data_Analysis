# SQL_Data_Analysis

This project aims to provide insights into popular movies, rental trends, and consumer behavior through analyzing movie rental data. Through the analysis of film, actor, director, and customer rental data, we seek to address the following important questions:

•	Which genres do people rent the most?

•	Which performers and films are the most well-liked by viewers?

•	What is the average frequency of movie rentals, and who are the most regular renters?

In addition, we wish to comprehend the rental system's total effectiveness and offer the company insightful information to aid in decision-making.
